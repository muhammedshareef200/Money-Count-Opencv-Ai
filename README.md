# Money-Count-Opencv-Ai

Money-Count-Opencv-Ai is a Python-based project that uses OpenCV to count and recognize different denominations of currency notes. This project leverages computer vision techniques to accurately detect and tally the number of each type of currency note in an image or video stream.

## Features

- Detect and count various denominations of currency notes.
- High accuracy and performance using OpenCV.
- Easy to integrate with other Python-based projects.
- Simple and intuitive user interface.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- NumPy

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/muhammedshareef200/Money-Count-Opencv-Ai.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Money-Count-Opencv-Ai
    ```

3. Create a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

4. Activate the virtual environment:
    - On Windows:
      ```bash
      venv\Scripts\activate
      ```
    - On macOS and Linux:
      ```bash
      source venv/bin/activate
      ```

5. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Ensure your virtual environment is activated.
2. Run the main script:
    ```bash
    python money.py
    ```

3. Follow the on-screen instructions to provide an image or video stream for currency detection and counting.
